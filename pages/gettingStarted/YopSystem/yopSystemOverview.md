In Yop models are represented using the class `YopSystem`. A typical system is an ordinary differential equation (ODE), but semi-explicit algebraic differential equations (DAEs) of differential index 1 are supported.

### Declaration
How to declare how `YopSystems` are found the [systems](yopSystem) page.

#### Links
[Supported systems](yopSystem#supported-systems)

[Declaration](yopSystem#declaration)

[System variables](yopSystem#yopsystem-variables)

[Using a model function/file](yopSystem#the-model-entry)

### Connections
How to connect systems using `YopConnection` is found on the [connections](connections) page.

### Modeling limitations
Modeling limitations due to the symbolic representation of models are found on the [limitations](yopSystemLimitations) page.

### Independent variables
How the independent variable is treated for `YopSystem`s are found on the [independent variable](independent) page.
