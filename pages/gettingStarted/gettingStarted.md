To get started with Yop you can either start from examples, you can visit the Yop [examples page](examples). You can also read more about Yop under the different categories.

# Basics
The basics of Yop can be understood from the three base classes `YopSystem`, `YopOcp`, and `YopSimulator`.

The `YopSystem` class is used for representing systems, or models. This is necessary in order to formulate and solve optimal control problems (OCPs), and for setting up simulations. More information about `YopSystem` is found at the [`YopSystem`](yopSystemOverview) page.

The `YopOcp` class is used for formulating and solving optimal control problems. More information on this class is found at the [`YopOcp`](yopOcp) page.

The `YopSimulator` class is used for simulations. The main purpose of this class is to be used as a way of finding an initial guess for non-convex optimal control problems. The class supports semi-explicit DAEs of differential index 1. The main idea of supporting DAEs of index one is the ability to connect ODEs consisting of a system and a controller via an algebraic constraint. More info is found at the [`YopSimulator`](yopSimulator) page.
