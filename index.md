## What is Yop?
Yop is a MATLAB Toolbox for numerical optimal control. It utilizes CasADi to interface to integrators and nonlinear optimization solvers, and thereof its name, Yop - Yet Another Optimal Control Problem Parser.

## Goals
We aim to make optimization easy enough for it to be a aiding tool when validating models and creating control strategies instead of it being a separate part of the project.
